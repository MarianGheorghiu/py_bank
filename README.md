# CLI Banking App

Welcome to the CLI Banking App! This is a demo, command-line interface (CLI) banking application built using Python.

## Overview

This project is a banking app designed to run in your terminal. You will be able to perform some banking operations such as checking your balance, depositing money, and withdrawing funds and so on. Please note, this is a **demo project** and should not be considered a fully-fledged, advanced banking solution. 

## Features

- Check current balance
- Deposit money into your account
- Withdraw money from your account
- User-friendly CLI interface
- Simple and easy-to-use

## How It Works

To use the app, simply run it in your terminal. You will be prompted to press numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.) to select various options. 

This is a **pure CLI app**, so no GUI will be involved, and everything will happen in your terminal window.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cli-banking-app.git

2. cd py_bank

3. python3 main.py

**I will make a script to just use a start.sh, but for now it is what it is.**
